This data represents the Indian Road accidents, causes, High and low values of 2022
My Power BI project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of road accidents in India, focusing on different types of roads and various vehicles involved. The dataset encompasses data from national highways, expressways, and state highways, detailing the number of accidents, fatalities, and injured individuals, all categorized by state. Through intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards, my project offers a deep understanding of the patterns and trends of road accidents in each state, allowing stakeholders to identify high-risk areas and potential causes for concern. This valuable information can empower policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and transportation authorities to make data-driven decisions, implement targeted safety measures, and work towards reducing road accidents and enhancing overall road safety across the country.
